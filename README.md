# Next.js E-commerce Template

This project, `nextjs_ecommerce_template`, is a comprehensive e-commerce solution built with the T3 Stack and bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`. It leverages the power of Next.js 14, TypeScript, Zustand, Tailwind, NextAuth, Prisma, and Stripe.

## Project Status

This template is currently a work in progress. It already includes an admin dashboard and various e-commerce components, but I'm continuously working on it to add more features and improve its functionality. Regular updates will be made to enhance the project and add new features.

## Next Features

We are constantly working to improve and add new features to our project. Here are some of the features we plan to implement in the future:

- **Authentication with Credentials**: We plan to implement a secure authentication system that allows users to log in with their credentials. This will provide an additional layer of security and make our system more robust.

- **Internationalization of Admin Dashboard**: To make our project accessible to users around the world, we plan to internationalize the admin dashboard. This will allow users to use the dashboard in their preferred language, improving usability and user experience.

## Latest Features

- **Webhook Implementation for Payment Events**: We plan to implement webhooks to intercept payment events and perform database operations. This will allow us to automate processes such as updating order status and inventory based on payment events, enhancing the efficiency of our e-commerce operations.

## Built With

This project is built with the following technologies:

- [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/)

## Installation

To install and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   Use the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SwiichyCode/nextjs_ecommerce_template.git
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**
   Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies with npm:

   ```bash
   cd nextjs_ecommerce_template
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   This project uses environment variables for configuration. You can find an example of the necessary variables in the .env.example file in the root of the project. Create a new file named .env and populate it with your own values

4. **Initialize the database**
   This project uses Prisma for database management. After setting up your database and adding its connection string to the .env file, you can initialize the database with the following command:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

5. **Start the development server**

   Finally, you can start the development server with:

   ```bash
      npm run dev
   ```

6. **Accessing the Admin Dashboard**

   To access the admin dashboard, you first need to authenticate. Once authenticated, you can access Prisma Studio to modify the user role.

   Run the following command to open Prisma Studio:

   ```bash
   npx prisma studio
   ```

Your application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

Happy coding!

## Image Storage

For storing and managing our images, we use [Vercel Blob Storage](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob). This service provides us with a secure and scalable solution for our image storage needs.

In addition to Vercel Blob Storage, we also provide an option to use [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for image storage. Cloudinary is a cloud-based service that provides an end-to-end image and video management solution. It is easy to use and offers a generous free tier. (This template use cloudinary)

In our `next.config.js` file, we have configured Next.js to recognize images from our Vercel Blob Storage:

```javascript
images: {
  remotePatterns: [
    {
      protocol: "https",
      hostname: "[id].public.blob.vercel-storage.com",
    },
    {
        protocol: "https",
        hostname: "res.cloudinary.com",
    },
  ],
},
```
